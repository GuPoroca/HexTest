# HexTest  

HexTest is a **CLI application and Go package** built to make **REST API testing simple, structured, and accessible**.  

The primary goal is to help **QA engineers with little coding experience** quickly set up automated API tests, while also providing the flexibility for **developers and advanced QA engineers** to extend and integrate it as a Go package.  

✨ Key Highlights:

- **CLI-first approach** → Run and manage tests with simple commands  

- **Organized testing** → Create projects, suites, and tests with minimal setup  

- **JSON support** → Import/export test definitions for easy sharing  

- **Automation-friendly** → Execute tests in pipelines or local environments  

- **Future UI** → Planned HTMX + Templ based local interface for managing tests visually
